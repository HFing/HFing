## Hi there 👋

## About me :mortar_board:
I am a student, currently studying in Ho Chi Minh City Open University. From very early on in my life, I started to fall in love with technology  This love has helped me develop a very good technological mindset, and given me the curiosity to learn more. I firmly believe that **no amount of knowledge is enough knowledge**. 🧠

## What I know :computer:
- **Competitive Programming**
	- Python ❤️
	- C++
	- Some Java
- **Frontend Development**
	- HTML, CSS and Javascript :white_check_mark:
	- Bootstrap
	- React with Redux :electron:
	- ReactJS

## What I want to do next :thinking:
- Backend Development (to become a Full-Stack developer)
- At least delve into AI and ML.
- Unlock the secret to the universe :rofl:
